## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Filter buttons not showing
- **Solution:** Wait 5 minutes for Render auto-deployment
- **Check:** Render dashboard deployment status

### Issue: Can't select exam type when creating test
- **Solution:** Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- **Check:** Clear browser cache

### Issue: Database error when creating test
- **Solution:** Migration already applied successfully
- **Check:** Run verification query (see below)

### Verify Migration:
```bash
PGPASSWORD=0zIF5xYGfxSz8IMi2IpGiK0NPOb7ozvl psql \
  -h dpg-d3mcetidbo4c73boac30-a.oregon-postgres.render.com \
  -U chemistry_test_db_user chemistry_test_db \
  -c "\d tests"
```

Should show `exam_type` column with type `character varying(20)`
