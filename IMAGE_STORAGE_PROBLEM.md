# Image Storage Problem on Render

## **THE PROBLEM**

Render's free tier has **ephemeral storage** - any files uploaded to the filesystem are **deleted when:**
- The service restarts
- You deploy new code
- The service goes to sleep and wakes up

This is why your images disappear!

## **SOLUTIONS**

You have 3 options:

### **Option 1: Cloudinary (RECOMMENDED - FREE & EASY)**

Free tier: 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month

**Steps:**
1. Sign up at https://cloudinary.com
2. Get your credentials (Cloud name, API key, API secret)
3. Add them to Render environment variables
4. I'll update the code to use Cloudinary

**Pros:**
- ✅ Free forever
- ✅ Automatic image optimization
- ✅ Fast CDN delivery
- ✅ Easy to implement

### **Option 2: AWS S3 (More Complex)**

Requires AWS account and setup

**Pros:**
- Very reliable
- Industry standard

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Requires AWS account
- Billing can be confusing

---

### **Option 3: Store Images in PostgreSQL as Base64 (Quick Fix)**

Store images directly in the database as base64 strings

**Pros:**
- ✅ No external service needed
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ Free

**Cons:**
- ❌ Larger database size
- ❌ Slower performance for many images
- ❌ Free PostgreSQL limit is 1GB

## **MY RECOMMENDATION**

**For your use case (chemistry test platform), use Option 3 (PostgreSQL) for now:**

Reasons:
1. **Quick** - No external service signup needed
2. **Free** - Already have PostgreSQL
3. **Sufficient** - You won't have thousands of images
4. **Works immediately** - No configuration needed

Later, you can migrate to Cloudinary if you need better performance.

---

## **What I'll Do Now:**

I'll update the code to store images as base64 in PostgreSQL. This will:
- ✅ Make images persist across deployments
- ✅ Work immediately without any external service
- ✅ Require no additional setup on Render

**Do you want me to implement the PostgreSQL base64 solution now?** (It's the fastest fix)

Or would you prefer Cloudinary? (Better long-term, but requires signup)
