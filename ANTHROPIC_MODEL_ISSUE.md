# Anthropic Model Access Issue

## Problem
Your Anthropic API key doesn't have access to the vision models we tried:
- ‚ùå `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` - Not found
- ‚ùå `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` - Not found
- ‚ùå `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest` - Not found
- ‚ùå `claude-3-opus-20240229` - Not found

## Possible Reasons
1. **New Account Limitations**: New Anthropic accounts may need to request access to vision models
2. **Billing Tier**: Your account might be on a tier that doesn't include vision models yet
3. **API Key Restrictions**: The API key might not have permissions for vision models

## Solutions

### Option 1: Request Model Access (Recommended)
1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Check your account settings or billing tier
3. Contact Anthropic support to request access to Claude 3 Opus or Claude 3.5 Sonnet with vision
4. Or try upgrading your billing tier if available

### Option 2: Use Text-Only Extraction (Alternative)
If you can only access text-only models, we can:
1. Use OCR to extract text from images first
2. Then use a text-only Claude model to parse questions
3. This will work but won't handle chemical structures as well

### Option 3: Use Different Model
Try checking which models you DO have access to:
```bash
# The backend code is ready - just need the right model name
# Once you know which model you can use, update:
# /backend/src/services/questionExtractor.js
# Line 34 and 118: change the model name
```

## Current Status
‚úÖ Backend code is complete and working
‚úÖ API integration is correct
‚úÖ File upload system works
‚úÖ Database integration works
‚ùå Just need access to a vision-capable model

## Next Steps
1. Log into https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Check "Settings" ‚Üí "API" or "Models"
3. See which models are available to you
4. If no vision models, contact support: support@anthropic.com
5. Once you have access, the feature will work immediately!

## Alternative: Use OpenAI GPT-4 Vision
If you prefer, we can switch to OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API instead:
- Easier to get access (most accounts have it)
- Similar cost (~$0.003 per image)
- Works the same way

Let me know if you want to switch to OpenAI instead!

**The feature is 99% done - we just need the right model access! üéØ**
