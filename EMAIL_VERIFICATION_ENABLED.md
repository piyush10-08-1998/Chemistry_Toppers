# Email Verification Now Required for Students! âœ…

## What Changed:

**Students MUST now verify their email** before they can login. This prevents fake registrations and spam accounts.

**You (admin) can login without verification** - Your account (`teacher@chemistry.com`) is automatically trusted.

---

## How It Works:

### For Students:
1. Student registers on the website
2. Gets success message: "Registration successful! Please check your email to verify your account."
3. Receives verification email from `pmandavi227@gmail.com`
4. Clicks verification link in email
5. Email is verified âœ…
6. Can now login and take tests!

### For You (Admin/Teacher):
- Login with `teacher@chemistry.com` â†’ Works immediately (no verification needed)
- You're automatically verified in the database

### For Other Teachers:
- Can register, but may need manual verification
- Currently set to skip verification for teachers

---

## What Was Fixed:

1. âœ… **Students must verify email** - Prevents fake/spam registrations
2. âœ… **Admin can skip verification** - Your account works immediately
3. âœ… **Email verification always enabled for students** - No longer depends on environment variable
4. âœ… **Frontend shows correct messages** - Students see "check your email", teachers see "you can login"

## Testing:

### Test Student Registration:
1. Go to: https://chemistry-toppers-frontend.onrender.com
2. Click "Register"
3. Fill in student details with a **real email you can access**
4. Click Register
5. Should see: "Registration successful! Please check your email to verify your account."
6. Check that email inbox
7. Click the verification link
8. Try to login â†’ Should work! âœ…

### Test Admin Login:
1. Go to: https://chemistry-toppers-frontend.onrender.com
2. Login with:
   - Email: `teacher@chemistry.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. Should login immediately (no verification needed) âœ…

## Email Details:

- **From:** Chemistry Toppers <pmandavi227@gmail.com>
- **Subject:** Verify Your Email - Chemistry Toppers
- **Link expires:** 24 hours
- **Verification link:** Redirects to `/verify-email?token=xxxxx`

---

## Code Changes:

### Backend (`server-db.js`):
- Login: Requires verification for students only (line 152)
- Registration: Always sends verification email for students (line 227)
- Admin email (`teacher@chemistry.com`) automatically skips verification

### Frontend (`Login.tsx`):
- Shows "check your email" message for student registrations
- Shows "you can login" for teacher registrations
- Displays verification instructions

---

## Important Notes:

1. **Deployment:** Changes are pushed to GitHub. Render will auto-deploy in 3-5 minutes.
2. **Email Service:** Using Gmail SMTP with app password `ghjzgibjyfnvkmuy`
3. **Admin Account:** `teacher@chemistry.com` is pre-verified in database
4. **No ENV Variable Needed:** Email verification for students is now ALWAYS enabled (hardcoded)

---

## Troubleshooting:

**Student says "email not received":**
- Check spam folder
- Make sure they entered correct email
- Email comes from `pmandavi227@gmail.com`
- Link expires in 24 hours

**Student clicked link but can't login:**
- Make sure they're using the exact email they registered with
- Check if token expired (24 hours)
- They may need to register again

**Admin can't login:**
- Make sure using exact email: `teacher@chemistry.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Your account skips verification automatically

---

**All set! Students will now need to verify their email, but you can login immediately.** ðŸŽ‰
