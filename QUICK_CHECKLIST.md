## Priority Order:

1. **HIGH PRIORITY** - Steps 1-4 (Student features)
   - Question navigation (improves test-taking experience)
   - Results page (students see their performance)

2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Step 5 (Teacher features)
   - Detailed analytics (teachers see student performance)

3. **LOW PRIORITY** - Polish
   - Add loading states
   - Add error handling
   - Improve UI/UX

## Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue: "Cannot find module TestResults"
**Solution:** Make sure you created the file in the correct location:
`src/pages/TestResults.tsx`

### Issue: "previousAnswers is undefined"
**Solution:** Make sure you initialized the state:
`const [previousAnswers, setPreviousAnswers] = useState<{[key: number]: string}>({});`

### Issue: "Network Error" when loading results
**Solution:**
1. Check backend is running: `http://localhost:5001/api/health`
2. Check you're logged in (token in localStorage)
3. Check console for errors

### Issue: Results page shows "No results found"
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you submitted the test
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Try API endpoint directly: `GET /api/attempts/results/[testId]`
